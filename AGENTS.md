# goon.vc Agent Hints (AI)

Public **HTML zipper** for the Fabric suite. Do not grow this tree back into a Hub
or a GoonCitizen relay.

**Topology (PLAN.md):**
1. `goon.vc` — this repo: GoonSPA HTML + same-origin Hub API proxy
2. `relay.goon.vc` — GoonCitizen LiveRelay (`star-citizen-live`)
3. `hub.fabric.pub` — generic Fabric Hub (contract registry, Beacon, `/sessions` owner)

**What this process is:** `@fabric/http` `HTTPServer` serving `assets/` and
reverse-proxying `/sessions`, `/device-links`, `/services/rpc`, and
`/identity/cluster` + `/identity/cross-sign` to `FABRIC_HUB_ORIGIN`
(default `https://hub.fabric.pub`). No Fabric Peer listen, no Bitcoin, no
`/services/star-citizen`. The one Discord gateway client is the read-only
metrics bot below (non-privileged intents, `autoCommands: false`, never
replies). Favicons are the suite lettermark
(serif **f** on royal purple `#4C1D95`) from `@fabric/http` `npm run make:icons`.
`/events` lists upcoming Discord Guild Scheduled Events from every server the
configured bot token can see (`GET /services/events`, REST only — no gateway
bot). Events are saved per guild in an on-disk Fabric Store (`stores/events`,
LevelDB) and requests are always answered from disk; Discord is polled on start
and every `ttlMs` in the background, a failing guild keeps its last saved events,
and the copy is served `stale` while Discord is unreachable. The page is a
single `<fabric-calendar>` Web Component (`assets/scripts/fabric-calendar.js`,
no goon.vc dependencies — the template for a Fabric-wide calendar control). It
shows the same week board as the PERMAFLEET schedule (`functions/scheduleGraphic.js`),
rendered live from that copy at `GET /services/events/schedule.svg?server=<id>&tz=<IANA zone>`
(endpoint default `America/Chicago`). Heading, description, counts, and every
control live on the board: the title picks the server, the zone label picks the
zone (default: the visitor's local zone; remembered in `localStorage`, kept in
`?tz=`), the footer downloads the SVG. The board's `#schedule-*` text ids are
the element's contract.
The home page shows a G00N SQUAD overview (copy in `GoonSPA` `overviewParagraphs`,
facts from the G00N record) and our own Discord member list built from the
guild's public `widget.json` (no iframe). The PERMAFLEET page lists cross-org
squadrons (`contracts/squadrons.json`); ALPHA SQUADRON's application is a native form posting to its Google
Form (`alphaSquadronForm`: `formResponse` URL + `entry.*` ids). Signing up there
is required for G00N SQUAD membership, even for PERMAFLEET members.
`/operations` lists the operations in `contracts/operations.json` — currently
only PERMAFLEET, whose **metrics** count the public PERMAFLEET voice channel.
Each entry names the Discord channels its metrics count (channel id, exact
name, or `"/regex/"`). `services/operations.js` runs a `@fabric/discord`
gateway client (Guilds + GuildVoiceStates + GuildMessages only) into a
`@fabric/discord` `MetricsPipeline`; plugins (`voice`, `messages` from
`@fabric/discord/plugins`) keep per-operation UTC day buckets in a Fabric Store
(`stores/operations`, key `/metrics/plugins/<name>`), checkpointed every minute.
`GET /services/operations` returns aggregate counts only — never member ids or
message content. Without a token (or with `GOON_OPERATIONS_GATEWAY=0`) stored
metrics are still served. New metrics = a new plugin `{ name, intents, init, on,
report }` plus a `metrics` entry per operation. `npm run link:discord` points
`@fabric/discord` at `../fabric-discord` for local development.
`/organizations` (plus `/organizations/<SYMBOL>`) lists PERMAFLEET member orgs
from `contracts/organizations.json`, a plain-text snapshot of public RSI org
pages refreshed by `npm run build:organizations` (never fetched at serve time).
`/resources` indexes guides and tools; `/resources/gooncitizen` describes the
GoonCitizen desktop app. `npm run build:downloads` copies the latest builds from
`../star-citizen-live` into `assets/downloads/gooncitizen/` (binaries gitignored —
over GitHub's 100 MB limit; only `index.json` is tracked) and the page renders
buttons + sha256 from that manifest. Interim only: future builds publish to the
Fabric network.
`/sessions` is the single login page (Discord, Passport, GoonCitizen desktop),
backed by the members Store under `/services/members`; `/members/login`
redirects there. The HTML client probes `OPTIONS /services/rpc` and
`GET /services/members` on load: Passport/desktop are disabled when the Hub
proxy is unreachable, and Login CTAs are hidden only when Discord login is
also unconfigured.
