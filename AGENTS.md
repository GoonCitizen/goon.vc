# goon.vc Agent Hints (AI)

Public **HTML zipper** for the Fabric suite. Do not grow this tree back into a Hub
or a GoonCitizen relay.

**Topology (PLAN.md):**
1. `goon.vc` — this repo: GoonSPA HTML + same-origin Hub API proxy
2. `relay.goon.vc` — GoonCitizen LiveRelay (`star-citizen-live`)
3. `hub.fabric.pub` — generic Fabric Hub (contract registry, Beacon, `/sessions` owner)

**What this process is:** `@fabric/http` `HTTPServer` serving `assets/` and
reverse-proxying `/sessions`, `/device-links`, `/services/rpc`, and
`/identity/cluster` + `/identity/cross-sign` to `FABRIC_HUB_ORIGIN`
(default `https://hub.fabric.pub`). No Fabric Peer listen, no Bitcoin, no
Discord bot, no `/services/star-citizen`. Favicons are the suite lettermark
(serif **f** on royal purple `#4C1D95`) from `@fabric/http` `npm run make:icons`.
`/events` lists upcoming Discord Guild Scheduled Events from every server the
configured bot token can see (`GET /services/events`, REST only — no gateway
bot). Events are saved per guild in an on-disk Fabric Store (`stores/events`,
LevelDB) and requests are always answered from disk; Discord is polled on start
and every `ttlMs` in the background, a failing guild keeps its last saved events,
and the copy is served `stale` while Discord is unreachable.
`/organizations` (plus `/organizations/<SYMBOL>`) lists PERMAFLEET member orgs
from `contracts/organizations.json`, a plain-text snapshot of public RSI org
pages refreshed by `npm run build:organizations` (never fetched at serve time).
`/resources` indexes guides and tools; `/resources/gooncitizen` describes the
GoonCitizen desktop app. `npm run build:downloads` copies the latest builds from
`../star-citizen-live` into `assets/downloads/gooncitizen/` (binaries gitignored —
over GitHub's 100 MB limit; only `index.json` is tracked) and the page renders
buttons + sha256 from that manifest. Interim only: future builds publish to the
Fabric network.
`/sessions` is the single login page (Discord, Passport, GoonCitizen desktop),
backed by the members Store under `/services/members`; `/members/login`
redirects there. The HTML client probes `OPTIONS /services/rpc` and
`GET /services/members` on load: Passport/desktop are disabled when the Hub
proxy is unreachable, and Login CTAs are hidden only when Discord login is
also unconfigured.

GoonCitizen release docs: `star-citizen-live/AGENTS.md`. Hub/core:
`docs/PRODUCTION*.md`. Human call for GoonCitizen contributors (not this zipper):
`star-citizen-live/DEVELOPERS.md`. This tree: [`DEVELOPERS.md`](DEVELOPERS.md),
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
